# GPARKIMDBProject

Project 1 Sprint 1

1. Gibeom Park.
2. You must create secrets.py and enter your own key. The project will connect to the IMDB API to retrieve a list of the top 250 TV shows and then retrieve a specific user rating.
3. A lot of time was delayed due to Python version issues and pip version issues.
4. I will continue to make corrections in the future.


Project 1 Sprint 2

1. Gibeom Park
2. The first table is the top 250 tv user rating infromation, and the second table and filled with information of the program include five programs.
4. I spent a lot of time trying the API more than 100 times a day because there was an error without knowing that I received an email. Eventually, I paid for the API, and now I can try many things, so it's really good.
