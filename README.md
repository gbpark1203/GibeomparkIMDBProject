# GPARKIMDBProject

Project 1 Sprint 1

1. Gibeom Park.
2. You must create secrets.py and enter your own key. The project will connect to the IMDB API to retrieve a list of the top 250 TV shows and then retrieve a specific user rating.
3. A lot of time was delayed due to Python version issues and pip version issues.
4. I will continue to make corrections in the future.
